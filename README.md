# RL_project_FlappyBird
This work presents an experimental comparison between a Monte Carlo agent and a Sarsa(Î»)
agent on the TextFlappyBird-v0 environment. We describe the setup and analyze the differences
in learning behavior and performance. Our goal is to highlight the strengths and limitations of each
method within a simplified reinforcement learning setting.
